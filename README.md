#Traffic Accident Analysis#

**Overview:**
This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to predict injuries using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing the data, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance. Additionally, the project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to uncover insights from the dataset.

**Key Features:**

**Data preprocessing:** Cleaning and encoding categorical features, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features.

**Model Building:** Utilizing Logistic Regression for injury prediction, and RandomForestClassifier for road surface classification.

**Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy score and classification report.

**Visualization:** Creating visualizations to understand accident trends, contributing factors, and geospatial distribution.

**Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping accident locations to identify hotspots and aid in traffic management and emergency response planning.
